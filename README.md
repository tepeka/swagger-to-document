# About

The intened use of this repository is to create a PDF document from an existing [Swagger](http://swagger.io/) API description. This container takes use from two tools:
1. [swagger2markup](https://github.com/Swagger2Markup): Creates AsciiDoc files from *Swagger* API descriptions.
2. [Asciidoctor](https://github.com/asciidoctor): Renders AsciiDoc files as PDF (for example).

# How To

## Create PDF from swagger YAML

The default container command creates a PDF document from a given *Swagger* YAML file.

`docker run --rm -it -v <path-to-documents-dir>:/documents tepeka/swagger-to-document`

There have to be two files mounted using the volume `/documents`:
1. `swagger.yaml` contains the full API documentation
2. `index.adoc` is used to bundle the single AsciiDoc files generated by *swagger2markup*. It can also be extend by manually written AsciiDoc files. Here is an example of a basic AsciiDoc index file:
```
include::./generated/overview.adoc[]
include::./generated/security.adoc[]
include::./generated/paths.adoc[]
include::./generated/definitions.adoc[]
```


# Example

The `example` folder contains a `update-api-doc` command to update the *Swagger* API in `documents`. 

Simply change the `swagger.yaml` API description or extend the `index.adoc` by manually written documentation and then execute the `update-api-doc` command to create the PDF.
